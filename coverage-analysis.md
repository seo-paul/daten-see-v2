# Test Coverage Enhancement Analysis

## Current Coverage Baseline
- **Overall Coverage:** ~30-40%
- **Target Coverage:** 70%+
- **Priority:** High-impact, low-effort wins first

## Coverage Analysis by Module

### 🔴 CRITICAL (High Impact, Must Test)
1. **Authentication System**
   - `src/lib/auth/token.ts` - 57.44% → Target: 85%
   - `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Already well covered via DI tests

2. **API Integration**
   - `src/lib/api/` - Multiple files at 0% → Target: 75%
   - `src/types/api.ts` - 47.05% → Target: 80%

3. **Store/State Management**
   - `src/store/dashboard.store.ts` - 75% → Target: 85%

### 🟡 IMPORTANT (Medium Impact)
4. **Core Components**
   - `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - 0% → Target: 70%
   - `src/shared/components/` - 0% → Target: 65%

5. **Utilities & Utils**
   - `src/lib/utils/cn.ts` - 0% → Target: 60%
   - Various utility functions

### 🟢 NICE TO HAVE (Low Priority)
6. **Performance & Monitoring**
   - `src/lib/performance/` - 0% → Target: 40% (lower priority)
   - `src/lib/monitoring/` - Already covered

7. **Query/TanStack**
   - `src/lib/tanstack-query/` - 0% → Target: 50%

## Strategy: High-Impact Coverage Wins

### Phase 1: Foundation Tests (Target: +15% coverage)
- API client and integration tests
- Core utility function tests
- Error boundary edge cases

### Phase 2: Component Integration Tests (Target: +20% coverage)  
- Dashboard components
- Auth flow integration
- Error state handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Scenarios (Target: +15% coverage)
- Performance monitoring hooks
- Complex business logic
- Edge case scenarios

### Phase 4: Fine-tuning & Optimization (Target: +5% coverage)
- Remaining gaps
- Error scenarios
- Documentation examples

## Success Metrics
- **Minimum:** 70% overall coverage
- **Ideal:** 80% overall coverage
- **Critical modules:** 85%+ coverage
- **Nice-to-have modules:** 40%+ coverage

## Test Strategy Balance
- ✅ Focus on integration boundaries
- ✅ Test complex business logic
- ✅ Cover error handling paths
- ❌ Skip trivial getters/setters
- ❌ Skip auto-generated code
- ❌ Skip simple utility functions
