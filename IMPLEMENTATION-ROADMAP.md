## 🛡️ **RISK MITIGATION & FALLBACK PLANS**

### **🚨 HIGH-RISK ITEMS:**

**1. External API Integration Complexity**
- **Risk:** Meta Ads API rate limits, auth issues, or policy changes
- **Mitigation:** Build CSV upload first, add APIs incrementally
- **Fallback:** Launch CSV-only MVP if API integration fails
- **Timeline Impact:** -1 week if API issues, CSV ensures launch capability

**2. Chart Performance with Large Datasets**
- **Risk:** Dashboard performance degrades with large data volumes
- **Mitigation:** Implement data pagination and chart optimization early
- **Fallback:** Data sampling limits and aggregation for performance
- **Timeline Impact:** Minimal if addressed in Phase 1

**3. Subscription Billing Edge Cases**
- **Risk:** Stripe integration complexity and billing issues
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple monthly billing, expand later
- **Fallback:** Manual billing for first 100 customers
- **Timeline Impact:** Can defer advanced billing features

### **⏱️ TIMELINE FLEXIBILITY:**
- **Phase 1:** NON-NEGOTIABLE (foundation must be solid)
- **Phase 2:** FLEXIBLE (can launch CSV-only, add APIs post-launch)
- **Phase 3:** COMPRESSIBLE (can defer advanced billing features)
- **Phase 4:** DEFERRABLE (can launch with basic monitoring)
